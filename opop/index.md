## Related works
 - The main idea of the first prototype was "Connect and destroy". It was not enough. I have added "Build and Collect" into this game after playing [Pokemon Go](https://www.pokemongo.com/) and [Euclidea](https://www.euclidea.xyz/). Collect your organic compounds as you collect Pokemons!
 - After I had completed prototype, I found this game - [Molecules, a chemistry game](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/molecules-a-chemistry-game/id910014218?mt=8). The mechanism is similar. "Hexagonal structure" and "Touch to cancel" are concepts from that game.

## Note
