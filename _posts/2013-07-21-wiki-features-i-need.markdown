### Co-work
 - Resolve conflict well (without lock mechanism)
 - Realtime editing using 'operational transformation' or 'diff-match-patch'


### Exporting to PDF
 - Fine quality enough to print to paper.


### Exporting to static HTML
 - Sometimes I need it.


### Usability
 - WYSIWYG editor - for non programmers
 - Section editing for long document


### Good point of Gitit
 - It uses Pandoc.
 - It uses Markdown (But Markdown doesn't support table well.)
 - It uses Git.


### Weak point of Gitit
 - WYSIWYG editor
 - Section editing
 - It uses Haskell.
   - Compiling Haskell code is slow.
   - I don't know Haskell.
 - Resolving conflict is low-level
 - Gitit doesn't support mv (although git does)
 - Need to write commit log even for small change
   - Merging trivial changes to last commit will be happy.
 - Attachments are saved to only root
