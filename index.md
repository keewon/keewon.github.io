# Keewon Seo
I live in South Korea, and work as a software engineer.

I am also a game developer.

I like [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker) - I'm not talking about Security related hacking. See [my gists](https://gist.github.com/keewon).

## Minesweeper in the dark
[Minesweeper in the dark](minesweeper/) is my recent game. It is full accessible and also gives unique experience to its player.

## Organic Pop
[Organic Pop](opop/) is yet another Match-N game except that your goal is building organic compounds.
