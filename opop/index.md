## Related works
 - The main idea of the first prototype was "Connect and destroy". It was not enough. I have added "Build and Collect" into this game after playing [Pokemon Go](https://www.pokemongo.com/) and [Euclidea](https://www.euclidea.xyz/). Collect your organic compounds as you collect Pokemons!
 - After I had completed prototype, I found this game - [Molecules, a chemistry game](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/molecules-a-chemistry-game/id910014218?mt=8). The mechanism is similar. "Hexagonal structure" and "Touch to cancel" are concepts from that game.

## Note
 - Software
   - [Gideros](https://github.com/gideros/gideros) is a cross-platform mobile development environment and it is used for this game.
   - [InChI](http://www.inchi-trust.org/) key and the software are used for internal algorithm.
 - Data and text
   - Most chemistry data are from [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and some are from Wikipedia. I deeply appreciate it.
 - Font
   - We use Gideros default font and [Google Noto Fonts](https://www.google.com/get/noto/)
